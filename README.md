# Django-TicketReservationsystem
I have create a sample website of a ticket reservation system. Requirements are python latest version, virtual environment, Django amd Mysql connector.
The zip file contains all the data you need to see the website. Try using it. If you are unable to run it then use virtual environment. I have created it under the name vemv.
